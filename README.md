Unix & Git for Everyone (Portland, August 22, 2015)
--------------------------------------------------
Final review of class



1. Rate today's workshop - scale 1 - 10
  I would rate today's workshop - 8



2. Things from today that I liked
 Beth is a very enthusiastic instructor
 She answers everyone's questions.
 The prework was a really good introduction to Unix commands





3. Things from today that I would improve.
  We spent a lot of time going back and forth with information on the fly.
  It would be better to have everything set up ahead of time because there
  is so much information that we feel that we are rushing through the material.
  The prework that covers the Unix/Terminal/Console basics does a thorough
  job, so I think that we spend a little too much time on that and not enough
  time on creating repositories, branches and pushing & pulling to GitHub
